## Overview

The Number String Generator is a simple Python application that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface. It allows users to generate a random string of numbers with a specified degree of "chaos". Users can set the length of the string, the degree of chaos (Chaos Degree), and the probability of newlines to generate a random number string according to specific rules.

## Features

-   **Length Setting**: Users can specify the length of the generated string.
-   **Chaos Degree Setting**: Users can set the probability of numbers changing during generation. The higher the chaos degree, the more frequently the numbers change.
-   **Newline Probability Setting**: Users can set the probability of newlines appearing during string generation.
-   **Display Results**: The generated string is displayed in a scrollable text area for easy viewing.

## Usage

1.  Download and install the required libraries (see Requirements section below).
2.  Run the `Number String Generator.py` file.
3.  Enter the desired parameters in the application interface:
    -   Length of the string
    -   Chaos degree (a decimal between 0 and 1)
    -   Newline probability (a decimal between 0 and 1)
4.  Click the "Generate" button, and the result will be displayed in the text area below.
